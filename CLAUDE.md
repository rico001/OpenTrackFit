# OpenTrackFit - Development Guide

## IMPORTANT: Public Repository
This is a **public open-source repository**. Never commit sensitive data such as passwords, API keys, tokens, IP addresses, hostnames, or any personal credentials. All user-specific configuration (WiFi, MQTT, HTTP webhook, profiles) is entered at runtime and stored in NVS on the ESP32 — not in source code. When making changes, always verify that no sensitive information is hardcoded or accidentally included.

## Project Overview
ESP32 firmware (PlatformIO/Arduino) that reads weight data from a FitTrack BLE body composition scale and serves it via a web interface. Supports MQTT and HTTP webhook forwarding.

## Build & Flash
```bash
pio run                # Build
pio run -t upload      # Flash to ESP32
pio device monitor     # Serial monitor (close before flashing!)
```

## Architecture
Single-file firmware (`src/main.cpp`) with these subsystems:
- **BLE**: Non-blocking scan for "FitTrack" scale, connects, subscribes to FFB2/FFB3 notifications
- **WiFi**: STA mode with AP fallback (config portal with SSID scan)
- **WebServer**: Weight display page (STA) / WiFi+MQTT+HTTP config (AP and STA via `/setup`)
- **Preferences**: Persistent settings in NVS (namespaces: `wifi`, `mqtt`, `http`, `prof`)
- **MQTT**: PubSubClient, connects per measurement, publishes JSON, disconnects
- **HTTP**: HTTPClient POST to configured webhook URL
- **NTP**: German timezone (CET/CEST) via `pool.ntp.org`, synced after WiFi connect

## BLE Scale Protocol (FitTrack / FT-DARA-WH01-GL)
- Scale advertises as `"FitTrack"` (device name `"SWAN"`)
- Chip: Dialog Semi DA14531
- Custom service: `0xFFB0`
  - `FFB1`: Write (commands to scale)
  - `FFB2`: Notify (weight data) — primary data source
  - `FFB3`: Write + Notify (command/response) — also subscribed for data
- **Packet format** (8 bytes on FFB2):
  - Bytes 0-1: Header `AC 02`
  - Bytes 2-3: Payload (weight or post-measurement data), big-endian
  - Bytes 4-5: Extra data
  - Byte 6: Type — `CE` = live, `CA` = stable/final, `CB` = post-measurement, `CC` = end-of-sequence
  - Byte 7: Checksum (low byte of sum of bytes 2-6)
- **Measurement sequence**:
  1. `CE` packets: Live weight updates (bytes 2-3 = weight in 0.1 kg, e.g., `04 03` = 1027 = 102.7 kg)
  2. `CA` packet: Final stable weight (same format as CE)
  3. `CB` packets: Post-measurement data sequence:
     - `FD 00`: First CB packet (purpose unknown)
     - `FD 01`: **Impedance data** — bytes 4-5 = BIA impedance in ohms (e.g., `02 4D` = 589Ω). **Only sent when barefoot** (skin contact with electrodes)
     - `FD FF`, `FB 00`, `FA 00`: Additional data (only sent when no impedance / socks)
  4. `CC` packets (e.g., `FE 10`): End of post-measurement sequence (only sent in socks/no-impedance case)
- **Barefoot vs. socks**: The scale auto-detects skin contact. Barefoot → sends `FD 01` with impedance, then stops. Socks → sends `FD FF`/`FB 00`/`FA 00` + `CC` packets instead, no `FD 01`.
- **Forwarding triggers** (whichever comes first): `FD 01` (barefoot), `CC` packet (socks), or BLE disconnect (fallback)
- Scale only activates BLE when someone steps on it
- Scale may stay connected for consecutive measurements or disconnect after one

## Body Composition
- **Always calculated** (requires profile with age, height, gender): BMI, BMR (Mifflin-St Jeor), metabolic age, visceral fat, ideal weight, weight control
- **BIA-dependent** (requires impedance from barefoot measurement): body fat %, muscle %, water %, bone mass, protein %, subcutaneous fat %, fat mass, fat-free weight, muscle mass
- **Formulas**: Kushner/Schoeller for fat-free mass from impedance, fixed FFM ratios (90% muscle, 4.5% bone, 23% protein, 73% water)
- **Graceful degradation**: When no impedance available, BIA fields are `null` in JSON and "k.A." in UI. `body_analysis` boolean in JSON indicates availability.

## Important Design Decisions
- **Deferred forwarding**: BLE callbacks set flags (`doForward`, `weightReady`), main loop calls `forwardWeight()`. Network operations (MQTT/HTTP) in BLE callback context crash the ESP32.
- **Three-trigger forwarding**: Forward on FD 01 (barefoot/impedance), CC packet (socks), or disconnect (fallback). `weightReady` flag prevents double-forwarding.
- **Atomic data update**: `bodyData` is only written in `forwardWeight()` → API always returns a complete measurement, no intermediate states visible to the frontend.
- **No BLE reconnect cooldown**: Removed because it caused missed connections when stepping on the scale again quickly.
- **Non-blocking BLE scan**: `pBLEScan->start(5, callback, false)` — duration must be >0 (duration 0 never completes). Keeps web server responsive.
- **Separate settings forms**: WiFi, MQTT, HTTP, and profiles each have their own save endpoint. MQTT/HTTP save via AJAX with inline feedback (no page reload). WiFi save triggers a connection test and restart.
- **No live weight display**: Only the last final measurement is shown (with timestamp and toast notification on update).

## Web Endpoints
- `GET /` — Weight page (STA) or config page (AP)
- `GET /setup` — Settings page (WiFi, MQTT, HTTP, API links)
- `POST /save/wifi` — Save WiFi credentials (tests connection, restarts on success)
- `POST /save/mqtt` — Save MQTT settings (AJAX, returns JSON)
- `POST /save/http` — Save HTTP webhook (AJAX, returns JSON)
- `POST /save/profile` — Save user profile (AJAX, returns JSON)
- `POST /delete/profile` — Delete user profile (AJAX, returns JSON)
- `POST /api/set-profile` — Set active profile (AJAX, returns JSON)
- `GET /api/last-weight-data` — Last measurement JSON (weight, body composition, `body_analysis` flag)
- `GET /api/docs` — API documentation JSON
- `GET /api/scan` — WiFi network scan (used by config page)
- `GET /api/settings` — Current settings and profiles (used by config page to prefill)

## Key Constants
All in `src/main.cpp` top section:
- `SCALE_NAME` — BLE advertised name to scan for (`"FitTrack"`)
- `AP_SSID` / `AP_PASSWORD` — Access point credentials
- `AP_TIMEOUT_MS` — AP auto-off (5 min / 300000ms)
- `WIFI_LOST_MS` — WiFi loss tolerance before AP fallback (60s / 60000ms)

## Hardware
- ESP32-WROOM-32 (ESP32-D0WD-V3) dev board
- Connected via USB serial (`/dev/cu.usbserial-0001`)
- Partition: `huge_app.csv` (3MB app, no OTA) — needed because BLE library is large

## Debugging
- **BLE raw packet logging**: `logRawData()` in `parseScaleData()` is commented out by default. Uncomment the call to see hex dumps of all BLE packets in the serial monitor — useful for reverse-engineering the scale protocol or diagnosing connection issues.

## Notes
- `include/config.h` is gitignored (legacy from early prototyping, no longer used)
- `volatile` variables are used for data shared between BLE callbacks and main loop
- WiFi+BLE share the ESP32 antenna — non-blocking scan helps stability
- Flash usage is ~57%, RAM ~19% — room for more features
